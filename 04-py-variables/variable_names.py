# Variable Names
# - A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more
# descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
# - A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# - A variable name cannot start with a number
# - A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and
# underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# - Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three
# different variables)

# legal or good variable names
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John1"
# example
print(myvar2)

# illegal or bad variable names
# 2myvar = "John"
# my-var = "John"
# my var = "John"


# Multi Words Variable Names
# Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.
# There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

# Camel Case
# Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

myVariableName = "John2"
print(myVariableName)

# Pascal Case
# Each word starts with a capital letter:

MyVariableName = "John3"
print(MyVariableName)

# Snake Case
# Each word is separated by an underscore character:

my_variable_name = "John4"
print(my_variable_name)
