    * Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
    * Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the \n\tEnglish language with influence from mathematics.
    * Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other \n\tprogramming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
    * Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such \n\tas the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages \n\toften use curly-brackets for this purpose.
