Why Python?
    * Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
    * Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
    * Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines \n\tthan some other programming languages.
    * Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as \n\tsoon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
    * Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a \n\tfunctional way.
