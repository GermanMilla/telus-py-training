Good to know
    * The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be \n\tusing in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than \n\tsecurity updates, is still quite popular.
    * In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible \n\tto write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans \n\tor Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.
